# pym - A math and numerical methods library in python

`pym` (pronounced <i>pim</i>) is a pretty simple numerical methods library for
python.  It can be used to do interpolation, extrapolation, integration,
normalization, etc.  In general, it is a replication of Brian Bradie's book
*A Friendly Introduction to Numerical Methods* in code.  Usage should be fairly
simple, with the documentation [documentation](docs/) providing a practical
guide to using the library.

## Pym Demonstrations and Screenshots
